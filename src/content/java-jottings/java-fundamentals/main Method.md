The `main()` method is a special method in Java that serves as the entry point of a Java application. When you run a Java program, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) calls the `main()` method to start the execution of the program.

The `main()` method must be defined as follows:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

The `public` keyword indicates that the method can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

The `static` keyword indicates that the method belongs to the class rather than to an instance of the class.

The `void` keyword indicates that the method does not return a value.

The parameter `String[] args` is an array of strings that contains any command-line arguments passed to the program.

The `main()` method can contain any Java code necessary for the program's execution. Typically, the `main()` method initializes the program's data structures and objects, performs any necessary computations, and prints output to the console or to a file.

The `main()` method can throw exceptions, which can be caught and handled by the program or propagated up to the JVM.

The `main()` method is not required for all Java programs. For example, programs that run as applets or as servlets in a web container do not have a `main()` method.
